# final-project
Coders Lab final project - simple page: portfolio.

Main banner and project headers animated. Images in headers are placed using jQuery. Text "O mnie" ('About me') slid down and up also with jQuery. Font Awsome icons and Google Fonts used. Site is prepared for implementing RWD (em and vh units and % used). I also want to test possibilities of ScrollMagic library.

What needs to be done:
--> sections "about me" and CV - to revise and update
--> graphic portfolio
--> RWD
